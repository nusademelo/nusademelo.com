					<div>
						<h3>Atticus Design System</h3>

						<div class="skills">
							<div>Semantic UI</div>
							<div>Design Systems</div>
						</div>
						<p>A comprehensive Figma library derived from Semantic UI and Atticus custom components forms a powerful yet simple design system. Guided by the Atomic Design methodology, it structures and organises everything from colours to typography and components to usage guidelines. The Atticus design system acts as a unified language between the design and engineering teams, ensuring visual consistency across features whether they use a default Semantic UI component or a customised version.</p>

						<h3>Full Text Search</h3>
						<img src="img/recent-work/full-text-search.svg" />
						<div class="skills">
							<div>UX Research</div>
							<div>Product Design</div>
						</div>
						<p>Full text search was a significant update to Atticus, allowing users to search for content across hundreds of documents when trying find contextual evidence during document reviews. The search feature addressed a previous limitation of only being able to search for document titles. The designs of full text search received positive feedback from customers and internal stakeholders alike, and the design components and patterns defined for this project are in use across multiple other updates to the platform.</p>

						<h3>Document Review Workflow</h3>
						<img src="img/recent-work/document-review-workflow.svg" />
						<div class="skills">
							<div>UX Research</div>
							<div>Product Design</div>
						</div>
						<p>I led the end-to-end design of a collaborative statement sign-off feature to address an initial limitation of the previous single-person approval setup. As the only designer allocated to this six-month-long project, I navigated various responsibilities to ensure the integration of this update with a suite of related product changes. The result is a tiered document review system that empowers multiple people to review and approve statements while providing a timely progress overview of the document review process.</p>

					<div>
						<h3>Mathspace Waypoints</h3>
						<img src="img/recent-work/mathspace-waypoints.svg" />
						<div class="skills">
							<div>Field Studies</div>
							<div>Usability Tests</div>
						</div>
						<p>Mathspace Waypoints is a continuous assessment tool designed to identify gaps in understanding in mathematics and foster a growth mindset. During the beta launch, I worked closely with the product team, conducting usability tests, field studies and data analysis to refine the tool effectiveness and user engagement. Leveraging my close relationships with customers, I helped the product team make informed decisions regarding the direction for future updates, ensuring ongoing improvement and alignment with user needs.</p>

				<h2>About me</h2>
				<div class="flex">
					<div>
						<p>I’m a self-driven product designer with a passion for continuous learning and a knack for problem-solving. My academic journey began in California, where I studied Pure Mathematics at UC Berkeley, cultivating a pragmatic approach to problem-solving that translates into my design thinking.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Growing up in Brazil, moving abroad and immersing myself in different cultures has allowed me to develop adaptability and wisdom to navigate challenges. So when l had to drop out of university and move to Sydney, I saw an opportunity to delve in the EdTech industry. This experience became a stepping stone in my professional growth and broadened my perspective on design.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I share more about my journey into product design in an episode of the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4vuxh2tcuZdEahoY7ZcFv4?si=c439caba71ed4bf4&nd=1&dlsi=af8ef5088c5c4de4" target="_blank">Digitally Diverse</a> podcast.<p>
            <br>
            <p>​​As an avid reader, I learn a lot from books, but my journey from mathematics to EdTech and product design at a LegalTech startup has taught me the importance of learning from hands-on experiences. Each project becomes an avenue for personal and professional growth.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As my design philosophy evolved, I developed a preference for timeless design, focusing on an invisible user experience and decisions grounded not just in data, but also in common sense.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Throughout my career, transparent communication and collaboration have been guiding principles and you’ll see me thrive in the dynamic and fast-paced environment of startups.</p>
